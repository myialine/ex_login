# ex_login
This is a login test with Express.js and may other modules.

I tested a login using Express.js following the steps as described by [Siddartha Boddu](https://medium.com/@siddarthasiddu96/user-login-and-registration-with-nodejs-using-express-bycrpt-and-mysql-529c872db5a0).
The packages used:

* [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [Express Session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session)
* [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)
* [ejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs)
* [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)
* [Sequelize CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize-cli)
* [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)

I had issues with my computer: 
* I could not use `locallhost` at all. As I could not find a solution, I used MySQLServer's `Port 3306` instead. It worked!
